This inseet has the same form and size as (J. pulum-a, the punctures of the
dark vitta and those of the external rows are, however, more distinet, and the form
of the vittae are different. The sutural one is not prolonges] at the base, but truncate
anteriorly at the scutellum, which, as usual, is dark eolored3 at about two-thirds the
length it is suddenly slightly dilated nearly to the apex. The outer vitta is a very
broad spot extending¹ three fourths the length of the elytra3 narrowed before and
behind, eonvex on its inner, but moderately emarginate on its outer surface about
the middle. (sec. Rogers l. e.)
